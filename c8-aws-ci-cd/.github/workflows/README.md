# Github Action Workflows
This repository contains several Github Action Workflows. You will find a description of eah one below.


## build-and-push-to-aws-yml
This workflow is used to build a Docker image containing the worker jar, and deploy it to AWS ECR and EKS.
For the required secrets, refer to [configuration for AWS](../README.md).
For configuration options of each step, refer to the links provided in the table below.

It has the following steps:

## deploy-bpmn-resources-saas.yaml and deploy-bpmn-resources-sm.yaml
These workflows are used to locate added and changed BPMNs, DMNs, and Forms. It then deploys these resources to a Camunda SaaS cluster, or a Camunda Selfmanaged (SM) cluster. 

For the required secrets, refer to [configuration for SaaS](../README.md) and [configuration for SM](../README.md). 

For configuration options of each step, refer to the links provided in the tables below.

### ðŸ”µ job: prepare-files

This job is responsible for collecting changed and added files.

| Select added and changed resources to deploy | outputs a json array of added and modified *.bpmn, *.dmn, and *.form files in the src/main/resources folder. deleted files are not included. | https://github.com/yumemi-inc/changed-files |

### ðŸ”µ job: deploy-modified-files

This job is responsible for deploying the files listed in the previous job. It iterates over the list of file paths, and deploys them one at a time.
It only executes if at least one file was found in the previous job.
